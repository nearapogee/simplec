# Simplec

### A CMS for developers, built by developers.

This gem handles all of the rote parts of a CMS, but gets out of the way for
everything else. In Rails it is easy to build things from scratch, but it is
a waste of resources to build again and again. This library is an attempt to
get all of the good parts of a CMS without the baggage of a CMS that takes
over the entire ecosystem.

## Dependencies
- rails >= 5.0.5

- pg >= 0.21.0; postgres >= 9.5

    We hate dependencies, but postgres is just too good. We use it for search
    and JSONB.

- imagemagick

    For image processing. Note there is a known vulnerability, please update
    accordingly: https://imagetragick.com/

- dragonfly

    We still hate dependencies, but this is a necessity and the best option.

## Recommended Dependencies

- summernote

    Used for editor fields. Source is included.

- bootstrap-sass >= 3.0.0

    Required if you want to use editor fields (which utilize summernote).

- jquery-rails

    Hope to be able to remove this, but required for summernote/bootstrap for now.

**The recommended dependencies are only required for the admin portions of your
application.**

_Optionally, you can create a separate set of assets for only the admin via
standard Rails methods. Or you could not include them and deal with the
fallout. ;-)_


## Features
- Pages with Templates

- Subdomain support

- Use application models or assets in CMS pages

- Search (coming soon)

## Anti-Features
- User management

- Permissions

## Proposed auxilary gems

- simplec-vlad: The easiest way to deploy and manage an installation.
  Database and file syncs between enviroments.

- simplec-blog: Don't always need or want a blog bundled in. (You might have
  your own.)

- simplec-admin: Opinionated, prebuilt way of managing pages. Take it or leave
  it. Or don't mount it and generate scaffold controllers and views for basic
  functions.

- simplec-events

## Usage

'www' is considered the default subdomain.

'admin' subdomain is reserved for administration functions if you wish.

If you want to modify all pages you should edit ::Page < Simplec::Page, this
will be generated in an installer later.

If you want to test a subclass of ::Page, make sure test has ::Page defined.

Create a public layout. The public layout is the default. This will be
generated in an installer later.

Put page model definitions in `app/models/page/`.

Put model templates in `app/views/pages/`. AND prefix with an underscore (_),
i.e. `_home.html.erb`.

TODO explain using uuids for keys + pgcrypto

TODO explain how to augment model classes (example in `test/dummy/config/initializers/simplec.rb`)

### Steps

1. Install simplec in your Rails application.

    See installation section.

2. Build and admin interface with the rest of your application.

    Simplec doesn't tell you how to do this. Currently, you should look at the
    test/dummy application for inspiration.

3. Then define a model:

    ```ruby
    # app/models/page/home.rb
    class Page::Home < ::Page
      field :tagline
    end
    ```

4. And the corresponding template:

    ```erb
    <!-- app/views/pages/_home.html.erb -->
    <h1>My Application</h1>
    <h2><%= @page.tagline %></h2>
    ```

    Note: You need to call `#html_safe` on fields with `type: :editor`.

5. And create a page in your admin.

6. Done.


## Installation

1. Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    ```ruby
    gem 'pg'
    gem 'simplec'
    # plus optional gems
    ```

    At this point it is assumed you are integrating Simplec into an existing
    application, logically then you have your database already configured.
    However, Simplec requires some postgres configuration. Please read the
    section below on Postgres.

2. Install and run the migrations

    ```shell
    rake simplec:install:migrations
    rake db:migrate
    ```

3. Mount the engine

    ```ruby
    Rails.application.routes.draw do
      mount Simplec::Engine => "/"
    end
    ```

4. Install and configure `dragonfly`

    ```shell
    rails generate dragonfly
    ```

    Then configure `config/initializers/dragonfly.rb`.

    It is recommended to use `rack/cache` or some other HTTP caching solution.

5. Optional - Install bootstap-sass.

    ```ruby
    gem 'bootstrap-sass', "~> 3.3.7'
    ```

    Currenty, we have worked out integration with Bootstrap > 3 and are waiting
    for the dust to settle on V4. See directions here:
    https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass

6. Optional - If you want to use the bundled summernote:

    Load the JS in your application's manifest.

    ```javascript
    //= require simplec/summernote
    //= require simplec/summernote-config
    ```

    Please note that this needs to be loaded after jquery and bootstrap.

    ```css
    @import "simplec/summernote";
    ```

    Please note that this needs to be loaded after bootstrap. And to use
    `@import` statements, you must use `.scss` files.

## Postgres

Note you will need to do this in your production environment as well. 

On some operating systems, `pgcrypto` is in a separate `postgres` package,
be sure to install that as well.

The `pgcrypto` extension is required for the `gen_random_uuid()` function
used to generate uuid primary keys.

1. Create your application postgres user (matching database.yml)

    ```shell
    # -s for superuser in development
    createuser -s myapp
    ```

2. Create databases and add pgcrypto

    ```shell
    # create development/test databases
    rake db:create

    # required for gen_random_uuid() function
    # used for ids in Simplec models
    #
    psql myapp_development -c "CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;"
    psql myapp_test -c "CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;"
    ```

## imagemagick

Installation varies per operating system. Image magic is used by dragonfly
for on the fly (then cached) image manipulation.

See this page for a good cheat sheet: http://markevans.github.io/dragonfly/imagemagick

## Roadmap

1. TODOS:

    - Embedded image id (integer -> uuid)

    - Check doc view helpers

    - Throw clear warning when creating a page without a type

    - Document `lib/simplec/controller_extensions.rb`

    - Document why _subdomain in subdomain form in admin.

    - rails generate simplec:install
      Install app/models/page.rb, app/models/page/
      initializer if needed, with options documented

    - rewrite beginning part of usage

    - simplec_path/simplec_url caching

1. Installer `rails generater simplec:install`

1. Upgrade summernote from 0.8.2 to 0.8.6

1. Search

1. Caching

1. Optional Gems

1. Remove as many dependencies as possible.

## Contributing
1. Use it and file create issues. Somethings are core, other things will be
  relegated to 3rd party extensions.
2. Pull requests are welcome. See rule #1.

## Running dummy application

1. Create simplec postgres user

        # -s for superuser in development
        createuser -s simplec

2. Create databases and add pgcrypto

        rake db:create

        # required for gen_random_uuid() function
        # used for ids in Simplec models
        #
        psql simplec_development -c "CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;"

3. Migrate database

        rake db:migrate
